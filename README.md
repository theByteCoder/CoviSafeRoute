# corona-safe-route

Since the Covid19 pandemic began, getting up everyday, the first thought that comes to many of our minds is - Do I need to go out today ? If I have to go out, how do I avoid Covid hotspots ?
To that end, we have developed an app that shows us the latest Covid hotspot areas and also give us the routes which are safe to traverse.
The routes marked in green are safe, the ones in red are to be avoided.
Developed in collaboration with Sk Asik and Manmohan Singh.
Data collected from console.geoiq.io, which collects and collates data from state goverment sources.

Here are some features of the app -

* Search any location and get all covid hotspot zones.

* Zoom in/ out of the location and move around in the map.

* Get safe routes from point A to point B. The safe routes do not pass through a covid hotspot zone.
